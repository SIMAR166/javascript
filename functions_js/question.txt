Perfect! 👏 Since you’re learning First-Class Functions in JavaScript, let’s strengthen your understanding step by step.

⸻

⚡ Quick Reminder:

A first-class function means functions in JS are treated like values —
✅ You can store them in variables
✅ Pass them as arguments
✅ Return them from other functions

⸻

🧠 Level 1 – Basics (Identify & Understand)
	1.	Write a function named sayHello that prints "Hello!".
	•	Store it inside a variable greet and call greet().
	2.	Create a function welcome() and assign it to another variable msg.
	•	Delete the original welcome variable and see if you can still call the function.
	3.	Create two functions:
	•	morning() → logs "Good Morning"
	•	evening() → logs "Good Evening"
Store one of them in a variable called currentTimeMessage and call it.
	4.	Write a function logFunction(fn) that takes a function as an argument and executes it.
	•	Try calling it as logFunction(morning).

💡 Level 2 – Functions as Arguments
	5.	Write a function runThreeTimes(fn) that executes any function three times.
	•	Pass a function that logs "Simar is learning JS!".
	6.	Create a function calculate(fn, a, b) where fn is a function that performs an operation (like add, subtract).
	•	Define separate functions add(x, y) and multiply(x, y) and pass them into calculate.
	7.	Write a function applyOperation(fn, num) that applies fn to num and returns the result.
	•	Test with square and double functions.

🔁 Level 3 – Returning Functions
	8.	Write a function outer() that returns another function inner() which logs "Inner function called!".
	•	Store the result in a variable and call it.
	9.	Create a function makeMultiplier(factor) that returns a function which multiplies any number by that factor.
