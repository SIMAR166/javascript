✅ Why these 20 questions only:
	•	They cover all important skills: loops, conditions, array creation, filtering, mapping, reducing, includes, find, remove duplicates.
	•	You don’t need to do every repetitive variation, but practicing these will make all other questions easy automatically.

If you want, I can make a tiny stress-free “daily practice sheet” with just 15–20 questions in order, so you can finish it in 30–40 mins/day and cover everything important without feeling stressed.

Do you want me to do that?
